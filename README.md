This movie ticket booking system project allows users to log in, select a movie, theater, show date and time, type of seat(premium, standard, or economy), and enter the number of tickets. 
After displaying the booking details, users can choose to book or cancel the ticket. 
If booked, users select a payment type (credit card, debit card, UPI, or net banking) to complete the payment. 
Upon successful payment, the ticket is confirmed. If choose to cancel the ticket, it updates the ticket status in the database accordingly.
